## React Projects Starter APP
### Reusable Component

This is a card component to show who's birthday is coming up this month.

You can either use an array which in this case is in the file data.js or you can use an API which in this case we are using an example API and comparing the values with the current date.

I've also let some commented code in case you want to make it more specific for example if you want the card to show only birthdays for the current day.

I'm using a free test API therefore the credentials are shown in the code however I do strongly recommend that if you are going to use the code with your own API create a doenv file so if you have to share or collaborate with someone else you can keep them private.
